### Payments related
<br><br>
**1. Can I pay in installments?**

No. I don't have an installment option.

**2. Can I pay using credit card?**

You very well can, but processing charges will be extra. You have to message me on whatsapp with your address, phone number and email. I'll create a razorpay link for you to pay.

**3. How should I ask for a refund if I am not satisfied with the course?**

You can message me on whatsapp or email me. This has to be done before the 30th day of the course.

On the 30th day, 5PM, the window closes.

**4. Can I pay half now, and half later?**

No. You can pay when you can pay full, before the registration window closes.

**5. Can I pay through bitcoin?**

No. I don't take crypto payments.

**6. I can't afford the course. What should I do?**

If you can't afford the course right now, most likely you can't put the course outcomes into play immediately. So, build your skills while you build your capital.

That said, start with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnr2P1OEPt4">my Introduction to Systematic Trading webinar</a> and drill down on each topic laid out there. Google about all those topics, read more and educate yourself. It's not rocket science.

### Course related questions

<br>

**1. I am not from tech background. Is this course for me?**

This course covers Python from the ground up, and leads you towards backtesting and systematic trading step by step. So, it doesn't matter if you're from commerce background or whatever other background. Every one of us started with zero knowledge in programming. So, it should not be a hindrance.

**2. How many hours of time investment will this course take from me?**

To watch the daily videos and do the assignments - 1 or 2 hours per day in week days, and 4-6 hours per day in weekends. That said, it might take more if you need to figure some things out.

**3. Will future batches content be made available?**

Only the immediate next batch's updated contents will be made available.

**4. Will you be able to provide guidance after the course is over?**

I will not be personally available to guide you or handhold you. I'll respond to the community questions, and so will the others in the batch, who will drive the interactions as a group.

**5. Will you provide us any good working strategies?**

I will not. Not in my best interest to do so. Not in your best interest either (you'll understand this later).

**6. Will Python help us plot and do bar-by-bar backtesting like Amibroker?**

With advanced animation and stuff - it can. But too much overkill. You can attempt that after the course though.

**7. What all will you teach outside of Python, Backtrader and Backtesting?**

The different topics covered in the Youtube webinar will be delved into, in detail.

**8. Will you teach how do backtest option strategies?**

I'll teach a method to backtest option spreads with options data. You can expand that method to apply to different option spreads and backtest.

**9. Can I contact you if I have any queries about the daily videos/assignments?**

All your queries should be on the forum group messaging service (telegram or whatever we decide). I don't have the bandwidth to personally respond to everyone. I'll respond commonly on the forum/telegram group. Unless absolutely confidential, I'd like for the conversations to be common in the group messaging so that everyone can learn from everyone's mistakes, questions, errors.

**10. I am a positional trader. Will this course be helpful for me?**

Yes. As long as you want to be systematic, no matter the timeframe, you can backtest anything.

<br><br>

### Backtesting related questions

<br>

**1. Will I be able to backtest anything I want, after this course?**

Yes, you will be able to.

**2. Will I be able to test option strategies after this course?**

Yes.

**3. Will I be able to test momentum based strategies?**

Yes, you should be able to.

**4. Will I be able to test trend following or mean reversion strategies?**

Yes.

**5. Will I be able to optimise the strategies in an automated manner?**

Yes.

<br><br>

### Live Automation related questions

<br>

**1. What is the cost of AWS servers?**

Please look up Amazon AWS website for this.

**2. Will you teach us thoroughly to automate on all the brokers providing APIs?**

No. The course for live automation will be primarily focused on Zerodha. Optionally, ***I'll go over Fyers API and Aliceblue API as an overview. I can't promise complete coverage.***

**3. Will you help us with live automation after the course ends?**

You should be able to do it with your own effort after the course. Any queries/doubts will go on the community messaging forum.

**4. Will Zerodha Historical Data API and live API both be needed for the course?**

Yes.

**5. Will you teach us how to handle exceptions and errors in the live automation process?**

Yes. That will be covered.

**6. What exactly would we do with telegram API?**

You would learn how to connect to telegram API and issue alerts whenever buy/sell happens. You can use the telegram alerts for every scenario you want to be alerted of.

**7. Should we subscribe to the APIs to learn the live automation?**

Yes - you should subscribe to the Zerodha API - for live trading and historical data.

**8. What are the costs associated with Live Automation?**

This will be discussed in the course.

**9. Once I finish this course, can I automate my system and be completely hands off?**

No. Live automation is not a utopia. There are many issues with live automation. Some we can control and handle at code level. Some we can't control and have to manually intervene.

So, no. Once you automate, you still have to have manual control. Broker APIs are not entirely 100% reliable. Even 0.01% of fault will cost you money.

Understand this with the analogy to Tesla. You can let it drive itself, but you should have the steering control whenever it is needed.
