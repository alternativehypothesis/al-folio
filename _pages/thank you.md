I want to thank you for taking your first step into the Alternative Hypothesis community by subscribing to my newsletter.
I will not disappoint you. Your time is very valuable just as mine, so I won't send anything that's not worth your time.
My curation process has a two-pass filtering mechanism. First, I add all the content that looks interesting to me onto my Pocket app.
Then, from within the app, I favorite the absolute best ones, discard the rest. This **"absolute best"** of all content is what you will receive every Sunday with this newsletter.
