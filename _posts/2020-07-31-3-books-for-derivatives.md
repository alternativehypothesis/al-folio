**To learn about derivatives trading, read and internalize the following books.**


1. Options Futures and other Derivatives - John Hull
2. Option Volatility and Pricing - Sheldon Natenberg
3. Options as a strategic investment - Lawrence Macmillan


There you go. I saved you at least one lakh rupees in seminar/workshops that teach you options basics. I also saved you another lakh on workshops to learn about option strategies.

If you thought you can learn and master options and futures within a day or two, you couldn't be more wrong. That said, if you have the patience to go over these books and take time to understand, it will serve you well. This way, you'd do much better than if you were to go through a workshop costing 50,000 rupees to 5 Lakhs.

Save your money. Spend 1000-2000 on these books if need be (you can easily find them online for free) and put in the work. No two ways about it.

NOTE: Natenberg's book and Hull's book are the most recommended books. These books are a regular feature on recommended readings at buy and sell side firms. Hedge funds, market making firms, proprietary trading firms, you name it.  Goldman, JPM, Credit Suisse, Citadel, etc., mandate going through these books during training.

So, watch and observe the FNO securities in the market every day. Strengthen your basics alongside to develop mastery over the theoretical framework. If you do this, you won't need to do anything else for your journey trading derivatives. You only need to apply your knowledge in practice.
